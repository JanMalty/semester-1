# To test that you can successfully download a file and upload it to gradescope

# You are going to write a very simple program:

# Ask a user to enter two numbers (one per input)
Num1=int(input("Enter number 1:"))
Num2=int(input("Enter number 2:"))

# multiply those numbers together
Total=Num1*Num2
# print out the result
try:
    print(Total)
# There is an extra point available for validating that they entered numbers!
except:
    print("invalid input !")
# Add to your code so that if they entered something other than an integer it prints
# 'That is not a number' and exits.
    exit()

# Download your file, and upload it to the 'Week 1 Session 2 - Practice Upload' task on Minerva.
# You will get some feedback - ensure you are passing the tests!
